Active Archives inverts the paradigm of uploading resources into a centralized
server and instead allows resources to remain "active", in-place and online.
Caching and proxy functionality allow (light-weight) copies of resources to be
manipulated and preserved even as the original sources change or become
(temporarily) unavailable.

Strategically, the project aims to clarify some of the "cloudy" aspects of Web
2.0 regarding issues of licensing, sharing, ownership, access, and longevity of
online material. 

This is alpha software with known bugs. It runs, and works at least some of the
time, but use at your own risk.
